Create a React web application that will be used to manage a
university library. You can use any backend of your choice (Ruby on
Rails preferred) for your application. The primary user will be the
college librarian.

1. The Web Application’s home page will show a ‘BOOKS’ section
— a list of books available in the library (create around 10 sample
books for your application). The list will show the book name,
author name, and a brief description of the book. The user
(librarian) can click a button or link for each book in the list to
view more details such as an extended description. The librarian
can also add books to the list using a simple form.
2. Another section in your web application will be the ‘STUDENTS’
section which lists students registered to borrow books. It will list
them by name, address. The librarian can add students to this
list using a simple form.
3. The librarian can navigate between the BOOKS and STUDENTS
section using a navigation bar on the top.
4. The librarian should now be able to visit the BOOKS section and
assign a book to a student by clicking an ‘ASSIGN TO STUDENT’
button for each book. When clicking this button, the librarian will
select the name of the student from a list and assign the book to
that student, indicating that the student has borrowed the book.
The book will then show who has borrowed it and when, and
how many days have passed since it was borrowed. Since a
student can keep a book for a maximum of 10 days, it will also
show how many days are remaining for the student to keep the
book.
5. Now, visiting the ‘STUDENTS’ section they can see which student
has borrowed which book. Each student can only borrow one
book at a time.
